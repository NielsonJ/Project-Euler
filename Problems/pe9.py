# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
# a2 + b2 = c2
# For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.

# 1000 = a + b + c
# c**2 = a**2 + b**2

# b = sqrt(c**2 - 1) 

# 1000 = 1 + b + c
# 999 = b + c

# 999 = sqrt(c**2 - 1) + c
# 999 = 2c - 1
# 500 = c


# c = 1000 -
